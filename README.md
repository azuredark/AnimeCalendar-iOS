# üìÖ Anime Calendar
Anime Calendar's iOS App - Schedule your seasonal anime to watch!

## üöß Project State
AnimeCalendar was put in hiatus for several months due to many changes happening in my life, including work & time constraints. However, after organizing my own life calendar/schedule, no pun intended lol, AC is **back in development!**. 
#### Any UI, or feature ideas feel free to make a PR or check the current [issues](https://github.com/Estremadoyro/AnimeCalendar-iOS/issues).

## üìê Architecture
AnimecCalendar uses the **VIPER** arch., with some twists, for creating and maintaining modules. It's planned to have different frameworks for specific services like UserNotifications, Style, etc. Some **design patterns** used are:
- Singleton
- Factory

## üåá UI
Uses mostly programmatic views and some Xibs. No storyboards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Dependencies
Current dependencies used:

- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) - Reactivity in the app (Aiming to eventually move to Combine)
- [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) - Managing images in a fast/easy manner.
- [youtube-ios-player-helper](https://github.com/youtube/youtube-ios-player-helper) - Loading trailers with a Google-YT-native player embed in the app.

## ‚õ©Ô∏è Setup
Currently, the project structure aims to make every screen a *root screen* meaning the app can boot from any screen in the app. The `BootManager.swift` module is in charge of said logic. You can boot the app with `.rootTabBar` or a specific `.rootScreen(ScreenType)`.
```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
    guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
    let bootManager = BootManager()

    // Boot from .newAnimeScreen
//    let rootController = bootManager.getRootController(.rootScreen(screen: .newAnimeScreen))
    let rootController = bootManager.getRootController(.rootTabBar) // Main boot

    let rootViewController = rootController.getRootViewController()

    window = UIWindow(frame: windowScene.coordinateSpace.bounds)
    window?.windowScene = windowScene
    window?.rootViewController = rootViewController
    window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
  }
```
