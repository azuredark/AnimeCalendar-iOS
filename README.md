# üìÖ Anime Calendar
Anime Calendar's iOS App - Schedule your seasonal anime to watch!

## üöß Project State
AnimeCalendar was put in hiatus for several months due to many changes happening in my life, including work & time constraints. However, after organizing my own life calendar/schedule, no pun intended lol, AC is **back in development!**. Any UI, or feature ideas feel free to make a PR.

## üìê Architecture
AnimecCalendar uses the **VIPER** arch., with some twists, for creating and maintaining modules. It's planned to have different frameworks for specific services like UserNotifications, Style, etc. Some **design patterns** used are:
- Singleton
- Factory

## üåá UI
Uses Xibs and some programmatic views.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Dependencies
Current dependencies used, not planning to add more
- RxSwift (w/ RxCocoa/RxRelay)

## ‚õ©Ô∏è Setup
Currently, the project structure aims to make every screen a *root screen* meaning the app can boot from any screen in the app. The `BootManager.swift` module is in charge of said logic. You can boot the app with `.rootTabBar` or a specific `.rootScreen(ScreenType)`.
```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
    guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
    let bootManager = BootManager()

    // Boot from .newAnimeScreen
//    let rootController = bootManager.getRootController(.rootScreen(screen: .newAnimeScreen))
    let rootController = bootManager.getRootController(.rootTabBar) // Main boot

    let rootViewController = rootController.getRootViewController()

    window = UIWindow(frame: windowScene.coordinateSpace.bounds)
    window?.windowScene = windowScene
    window?.rootViewController = rootViewController
    window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
  }
```
